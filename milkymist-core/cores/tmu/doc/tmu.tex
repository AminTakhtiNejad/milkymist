\section{Presentation}
Milkymist has hardware acceleration for texture mapping on triangle strips. This process is used to implement the image warping effect in MilkDrop.

The texture mapping unit also supports fading the colors of the image to black (decay effect).

The core deals with 16-bit RGB565 progressive-scan framebuffers, accessed via FML links with a width of 64 bits and a burst length of 4.

The vertex data is fetched using a 32-bit WISHBONE master. Connecting this bus to the WISHBONE-to-FML caching bridge allows the mesh data to be stored in cost-effective DRAM.

For controlling the core, a CSR bus slave is also implemented.

\section{Configuration and Status Registers}
Registers can be read at any time, and written when the core is not busy. Write operations when the busy bit is set in register 0, including those to the control register, are illegal and can cause unpredictable behaviour.

Addresses are in bytes to match the addresses seen by the CPU when the CSR bus is bridged to Wishbone.

\subsection{Parameters and control}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{10.5cm}|}
\hline
\bf{Offset} & \bf{Access} & \bf{Default} & \bf{Description} \\
\hline
0x00 & RW & 0 & Control register. \\
& & & Bit 0: Start/Busy.\\
& & & Bit 1: IRQ status. Cleared whenever the register is written. \\
& & & Bit 2: Enable texture coordinates wrap (vs. clamp). \\
\hline
0x04 & RW & 32 & Number of mesh squares in the X direction (which is the number of mesh points minus one, and also the index of the last mesh point). \\
\hline
0x08 & RW & 24 & Number of mesh squares in the Y direction. \\
\hline
0x0C & RW & 63 & Brightness, between 0 and 63. The components of each pixel are multiplied by $ (n+1) \over 64 $ and rounded to the lowest integer. That means that a value of 0 in this register makes the destination picture completely black (because of the limited resolution of RGB565). \\
\hline
0x10 & RW & 0 & Address of the source mesh data (texture coordinates). Must be aligned on a 32-bit boundary. \\
\hline
0x14 & RW & 0 & Source framebuffer address. Must be aligned on a 16-bit boundary. \\
\hline
0x18 & RW & 640 & Source horizontal resolution. \\
\hline
0x1C & RW & 480 & Source vertical resolution. \\
\hline
0x20 & RW & 0 & Address of the destination mesh data (vertex coordinates). Must be aligned on a 32-bit boundary. \\
\hline
0x24 & RW & 0 & Destination framebuffer address. Must be aligned on a 16-bit boundary. \\
\hline
0x28 & RW & 640 & Destination horizontal resolution. \\
\hline
0x2C & RW & 480 & Destination vertical resolution. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Performance counters}
In order to help tracking down performance bugs, the core has built-in performance counters.

Those counters are automatically reset when a new frame is submitted for processing, and must be read after the frame processing is finished.

These registers are read-only. Attempting to write them results in undefined behaviour.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{10.5cm}|}
\hline
\bf{Offset} & \bf{Access} & \bf{Default} & \bf{Description} \\
\hline
0x30 & R & 0 & Number of drawn pixels. Off-screen pixels are not counted. \\
\hline
0x34 & R & 0 & Processing time, in clock cycles. \\
\hline
0x38 & R & 0 & Number of stalled transactions detected at pipeline monitor 1. \\
\hline
0x3C & R & 0 & Number of completed transactions detected at pipeline monitor 1. \\
\hline
0x40 & R & 0 & Number of stalled transactions detected at pipeline monitor 2. \\
\hline
0x44 & R & 0 & Number of completed transactions detected at pipeline monitor 2. \\
\hline
0x48 & R & 0 & Number of misses in the source image (texture) cache. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Encoding the vertex data}
The core supports a maximum mesh of 128x128 points. The address of the point at indices $ (x, y) $ in the mesh is, regardless of the actual the number of mesh points:

\begin{equation*}
base + 4 \cdot (128 \cdot y + x)
\end{equation*}

This means that the mesh always has the same size in memory.

Each point is made up of 32 bits, with the 16 upper bits being the Y coordinates and the 16 lower bits the X coordinate.

Exactly 64KB are used by the mesh.

\subsection{Handshake protocol between pipeline stages}
Because pipeline stages are not always ready to accept and/or to produce data (because, for example, of memory latencies), a flow control protocol must be implemented.

The situation is the same between all stages: an upstream stage is registering data into a downstream stage. During some cycles, the upstream stage cannot produce valid data and/or the downstream stage is processing the previous data and has no memory left to store the incoming data.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=30mm]{comm.eps}
\caption{Communication between two pipeline stages.}\label{fig:comm}
\end{figure}

Appropriate handling of these cases is done using standardized \verb!stb! and \verb!ack! signals. The meaning of these is summarized in this table:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\verb!stb! & \bf \verb!ack! & \bf Situation \\
\hline
0 & 0 & The upstream stage does not have data to send, and the downstream stage is not ready to accept data. \\
\hline
0 & 1 & The downstream stage is ready to accept data, but the upstream stage has currently no data to send. The downstream stage is not required to keep its \verb!ack! signal asserted. \\
\hline
1 & 0 & The upstream stage is trying to send data to the downstream stage, which is currently not ready to accept it. The transaction is \textit{stalled}. The upstream stage must keep \verb!stb! asserted and continue to present valid data until the transaction is completed. \\
\hline
1 & 1 & The upstream stage is sending data to the downstream stage which is ready to accept it. The transaction is \textit{completed}. The downstream stage must register the incoming data, as the upstream stage is not required to hold it valid at the next cycle. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\

It is not allowed to generate \verb!ack! combinatorially from \verb!stb!. The \verb!ack! signal must always represent the current state of the downstream stage, ie. whether or not it will accept whatever data we present to it.

\subsection{Triangle filling}
The triangle filler is inspired by \url{http://www.geocities.com/wronski12/3d_tutor/tri_fillers.html} and is based on the following algorithm:
\begin{verbatimtab}
if (B.y-A.y > 0) dx1=(B.x-A.x)/(B.y-A.y) else dx1=B.x - A.x;
if (C.y-A.y > 0) dx2=(C.x-A.x)/(C.y-A.y) else dx2=0;
if (C.y-B.y > 0) dx3=(C.x-B.x)/(C.y-B.y) else dx3=0;

S=E=A;
if(dx1 > dx2) {
	for(;S.y<=B.y;S.y++,E.y++,S.x+=dx2,E.x+=dx1)
		horizline(S.x,E.x,S.y);
	E=B;
	for(;S.y<=C.y;S.y++,E.y++,S.x+=dx2,E.x+=dx3)
		horizline(S.x,E.x,S.y);
} else {
	for(;S.y<=B.y;S.y++,E.y++,S.x+=dx1,E.x+=dx2)
		horizline(S.x,E.x,S.y);
	S=B;
	for(;S.y<=C.y;S.y++,E.y++,S.x+=dx3,E.x+=dx2)
		horizline(S.x,E.x,S.y);
}
\end{verbatimtab}

The coordinates of vertices are (A.x,A.y), (B.x,B.y), (C.x,C.y) ; we assume that $A.y \leq B.y \leq C.y$ (the points are sorted first). \verb!dx1!, \verb!dx2!, \verb!dx3! are deltas used in interpolation ; in the TMU implementation a variant of the Bresenham algorithm is used to avoid approximation errors associated with fixed point or floating point formats. The \verb!horizline! procedure draws an horizontal segment between points (S.x,Y), (E.x,Y).

Using a similar algorithm, the TMU interpolates image coordinates at the same time it fills the triangle.
