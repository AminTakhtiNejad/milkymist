[> Milkymist(tm) Presenter
--------------------------------------

This very simple firmware for the Milkymist visual synthesizer has two purposes:
* exemplify how to write a custom firmware
* make presentations about Milkymist using itself :o)

Milkymist is an opensource VJing system-on-chip for FPGA boards,
compatible with MilkDrop presets.
For the latest releases, binary distributions and more:

[> Generating the files for your talk
To keep the firmware really simple, it takes raw 640x480 RGB565 pictures from the
memory card (and just writes them to the framebuffer).
You will therefore need to convert them using the supplied "makeraw" tool.

To compile the tool:
install libgd (http://www.libgd.org) and cmake (http://www.cmake.org),
go to the "makeraw/build" directory and type:
cmake ..
make

To convert a PDF file (from Beamer for example) to a set of 640x480 PNG files:
gs -SDEVICE=png16m -r127x127 -sOutputFile=PR%04d.PNG -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \
	-dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -- slides.pdf

To convert the PNGs to raw RGB565 images for use with Presenter:
for i in *.PNG; do /path/makeraw $i; done

The files must be placed at the root of the memory card, and named PR0001.RAW,
PR0002.RAW, and so forth.

[> Compiling the firmware
You need a source distribution of Milkymist, a Mico32 toolchain, and the library
must be compiled (go to software/lib in the Milkymist distribution and type "make")

Then, cd to the "firmware" directory of Presenter, and type
make MMDIR=path_to_milkymist_sources

MMDIR must point to the "milkymist-core" directory (if you downloaded a complete package).

This will generate a "BOOT.BIN" file, that can be loaded using the usual techniques (placed
at the root of the memory card, using flterm, etc.)

[> Using Presenter
At startup, Presenter will automatically display the PR0001.RAW image.
Use the left and right keys of your FPGA board to switch between images.
